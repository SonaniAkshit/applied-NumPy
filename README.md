# NumPy for Data Science

This repository documents my **focused and structured learning of NumPy**, built specifically for a **data science career**.

The goal is not to cover every NumPy feature.
The goal is to **master the NumPy concepts that are actually used** in real-world data science, machine learning, and numerical computing.

This repository is designed to build a **strong mental model of arrays, shapes, axes, and vectorized operations**, which makes Pandas, ML, and deep learning much easier to understand later.

## 🎯 Repository Goal

To become **comfortable, confident, and precise with NumPy** as the numerical backbone of data science.

By completing this repository, I aim to:

* Think in terms of **arrays instead of loops**
* Clearly understand **rows, columns, shapes, and axes**
* Write **clean, efficient, vectorized NumPy code**
* Build a strong foundation for **Pandas, ML, and DL**

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each topic is organized in **one separate folder**, following the same clean structure:

```
topic_name/
│
├── notes.md                 # Detailed concept notes
├── topic_name.pdf           # PDF version of the notes
├── practice.ipynb           # Practical experiments and exercises
```

This structure supports:

* Clear concept understanding
* Easy revision
* Practical application

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

* One topic at a time
* Concepts before shortcuts
* Practice after every topic
* Focus on understanding, not memorization
* No rushing, no overload

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Python
* NumPy
* Jupyter Notebook
* Git & GitHub

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* This is a **learning-focused repository**
* Notes and code may be refined over time
* Priority is **clarity, correctness, and depth**
* Speed is intentionally not the focus
